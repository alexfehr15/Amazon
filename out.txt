<class 'str'>{"price_rent": "", "authors": ["Visit Amazon's George R.R. Martin Page"], "title": "A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1)", "price_new": "$5.99", "reviews": ["\nFirst off, I'm a heavy duty fan of GRRM. I've read over a 100 different  fantasy authors in my time (started at 12; I'm now 32). Took about 5  years off from the genre b/c I felt it was all getting too formulaic and  cliched.  So, when I came back to fantasy at the end of 1999, I read the usual:  Goodkind, Jordan, etc. and then someone told me about GRRM and  man, that was the kicker!  Here are the reasons to choose GRRM. I've also listed the reasons not to  choose him to make it fair b/c I know their are certain personalities who  won't like this series:  WHY TO READ GRRM  (1) YOU ARE TIRED OF FORMULAIC FANTASY: good lad beats  the dark lord against impossible odds; boy is the epitome of good; he and  all his friends never die even though they go through great dangers . . . the  good and noble king; the beautiful princess who falls in love with the  commoner boy even though their stations are drastically different  . . . you get the idea.  After reading this over and over, it gets old.  (2) YOU ARE TIRED OF ALL THE HEROES STAYING ALIVE  EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE UNDER CONSTANT DANGER: this  gets even worse where the author kills a main hero off but that person  comes back later in the story. Or, a hero does die but magic brings him  back.  This sometimes carries to minor characters where even they may not die,  but most fantasy authors like to kill them off to show that some risked the  adventure and perished.  (3) YOU ARE A MEDIEVAL HISTORY BUFF: this story was  influenced by the WARS OF THE ROSES and THE HUNDRED  YEARS WAR.  (4) YOU LOVE SERIOUS INTRIGUE WITHOUT STUPID  OPPONENTS: lots of layering; lots of intrigue; lots of clever players in  the game of thrones.Read more \u203a\n", "\nI spent quite a while staring at the blank screen in front of me to come up with a fitting description of A Game of Thrones by George RR Martin.  Should I compare it to the classic Lord of the Rings for its impressively epic scope?  Would it be best to focus on the honest, often painful humanity of the many characters - so rare in a fantasy novel - that personalizes each point of view?  Perhaps I could impress other customers here with the sheer brilliance of a plot that weaves so many seemingly disparate stories together to form a believable alternate universe in which not only politics, intrigue, war, adventure and romance can coexist plausibly, but magic as well.  How could I do such a work justice?I might as well get this part out of the way first.  Obligatory Synopsis:  in a fantasy continent that bears a familiarity to Middle Ages England, Winter is coming.  Winter in this world means a sort of mini ice age that will last for seven years before receding. In the always-frosty Northern area, the races of nonhuman beings are gathering to advance with the snows; there are hints that there is an ancient, evil power behind their forces.  At the same time in the South, political infighting for the Throne has begun. Overseas, the daughter of the dispossessed former King is maneuvering forces of her own for a bid for the throne.  All this is told through the various stories of both \"good guys\" and not-so-good guys.For starters, AGOT can't be accurately compared to any other book or series in the Fantasy genre (not without insulting it).  The nearest thing of its type is the laborious Wheel of Time series by Jordan - see what I mean? And yet this first in the Song of Ice and Fire series is fathoms above that aimless, droning style.Read more \u203a\n", "\n  NB: THIS REVIEW REFERS TO THE KINDLE EDITION ALONE!  This is a great book, and I've eaten up the series and have been on tenterhooks for George RR to get his finger out and publish A Dance with Dragons for YEARS now.  (And the tv series!! Be still my beating heart!!!)  But I have to comment on the extremely bad editing of the Kindle edition of A Game of Thrones.  It is sloppy and unprofessional.  When I first got my kindle, I never experienced this, but now it seems like every book gets worse and worse.  I thought Sacajawea was bad, but A Game of Thrones starts out with poor editing and gets progressively more appalling as you get further into the book.  People who only read the kindle edition will think that Princess Elia comes from Dome, since that is how it is (almost) consistently spelled throughout the book.  (It's Dorne).  But on the other hand, the `tom cat' is a `torn cat'- go figure.  Little things like that at first, but now, in the last third of the book, the mistakes are coming on nearly every page.  Random parentheses, inappropriately capitalized words, italics that make no sense, sentences that end abruptly - that kind of thing.  It would be irritating, but something I would just accept in a free edition of a book (maybe).  But for a Kindle book that costs more than the paperback, I expect more.  I also own a hard copy of this book, and none of these typos are in that edition.  I'm not sure how the Kindle editions are made, but I expect the same kind of professional editing that you get in print books.  You don't get that here, disappointingly.\n"], "details": ["Mass Market Paperback: 864 pages", "Publisher: Bantam; Mti Rep edition (March 22, 2011)", "Language: English", "ISBN-10: 0553593714", "ISBN-13: 978-0553593716", "Product Dimensions: 6.8 x 4.1 x 1.7 inches", "Shipping Weight: 12.6 ounces (", "4.4 out of 5 stars", "5,190 customer reviews", "#186", "See Top 100 in Books", "Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Genre Fiction", "Movie Tie-Ins", "Books", "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "Fantasy", "Epic", "Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Genre Fiction", "Action & Adventure", "Movie Tie-Ins <span class=\"zg_hrsr_rank\">#4</span>", "Epic <span class=\"zg_hrsr_rank\">#22</span>", "Action & Adventure <span class=\"zg_hrsr_rank\">#33</span>"]}

Bursten"], "title": "Chemistry: The Central Science (12th Edition)", "price_new": "$214.20", "reviews": ["\n  I transferred schools and I needed Chemistry: The Central Science for Chem II.  The class listed that I needed the 12th edition but they also gave us Mastering Chemistry for free so I figured would just use the E-Book.  It turned out to be a pain so about five weeks into the semester I decided I needed a hard copy of the book and decided to check the difference between editions.  These are literally the same book with exception to Ch. 22 &amp; 23 in 11E and Ch. 23 in the 12E.  Most of Ch.23 in 12E is Ch. 23 with parts of Ch. 22 in 11E, you just have to know where you are supposed to be.  Also Ch.25 in 11E is Ch.24 in 12E.Even all of the end of chapter exercises are the same in 11E as 12E just numbered differently and some in different order, but all within the same section.  There are some that vary slightly, usually just values, but I'd say 97% are the same.  Not all of the sample questions are identical either throughout the chapter but most are.This is a great chemistry book, it is very easy to read and understand and if you put in the work you will see results.  Buy the Student's Guide and Solutions To Exercises (all exercises) and you will have no problems with this course.LASTLY: BUY 11e OVER 12e!!!!!! I paid just under $40 TOTAL (including shipping) for the 11e text, Student's Guide, and Solutions To Exercises (all exercises).  These books would run me almost $500 at the university bookstore and probably $300 by looking around online.\n", "\nI am ambivalent about Chemistry - The Central Science (or should I say, ambi-valent). It is a pretty good choice for a general (freshman) chemistry course; but chemistry majors should have a course that challenges the student with a faster pace, greater depth, and more math. In terms of content and depth, Chemistry - The Central Science is nearly identical to Chemistry by Raymond Chang. I prefer the Chang book for its clear and concise prose. Overall, I would say that Principles of Modern Chemistry by Oxtoby is the best general chemistry textbook for chemistry majors.This textbook is very good at what it teaches: every basic chemistry concept seems to have at least some coverage. Chapters are well organized. Information display (use of illustrations, tables, graphs, headers, bolding, and color) demonstrates a professional understanding of learning processes. The prose in the text is simple and easy to understand (I would guess that the book is written at the tenth-grade level). I love the illustrations in this textbook: they are very effective in developing \"mental models\" of the concepts. I like the thought-provoking questions sprinkled throughout each chapter (with answers provided at the back of the book). I also appreciate the glossary of terms at the end of the book. For what is covered, the textbook does a pretty good job.I question the pacing of this book. Perhaps the pacing is based on experiences teaching large populations of non-majors. Chemistry majors could move through this material much faster.Read more \u203a\n", "\n  I bought this textbook for chemistry II because I was so frustrated with the chemistry textbook by Silberberg. This one is so much easier to understand. It's also less cluttered with stuff on the pages which makes it easier to pay attention while reading. I also found that this textbook also gives more information on the material than Silberberg. The sample problems are much easier to understand and were much more helpful for the tests. Even buying this so late in the semester, it has helped tremendously.\n", "\n  I absolutely love this book! Theodore E. Brown makes reading every paragraph very interesting and in a very easy to read format (even for my seventh grader), and is very thorough. Pretty much no background knowledge about chemistry is needed to understand this book. It is also instructive and up to date.\n", "\n  I bought this book as an ADDITION to the chemistry book I was prescribed for my undergrad chem unit. This has got to be the best chemistry book I've read. I love the clarity, the readability, and especially the LOOK of the book. That's important to me. Books need to not just be bland piles of black text. They need good diagrams and photos, good headings and subheadings. They need to be attractive--I'm a visual learner, it DOES make a difference. This book is laid out perfectly, and it looks really good. I actually enjoy reading it. It's far better than any other chem book I've had.\n", "\n  Thick, heavy book with in depth explanations of all topics of general chemistry. Highly recommended for first and second semester chemistry, and handy to keep on the bookshelf after completing courses for general reference.\n", "\n  It's search tool is AWESOME for reading, referencing and notes!  Find the word and/or subject in seconds versus going to the index just to find what you think you are looking for is not worded that way or listed!  Highlight text and pictures to review with class notes and instant word highlight, click and get a definition on the web for anything in the book!  I can''t tell you how nice it is to have these books for the hard core bio classes, not to mention how easy it is on the back, LOL!  &lt;3 IT!

<class 'str'>{"price_rent": "$35.04", "authors": ["Visit Amazon's Mark Lutz Page"], "title": "Learning Python, 5th Edition", "price_new": "$38.99", "reviews": ["\n  I like how O'Reilly breaks out its PERL books. There is \"Learning PERL\" for beginners, \"Programming PERL\" as a reference, and \"PERL Cookbook\" for solutions. Alas, this book, a weighty tome that makes the dictionary look skinny, should really be renamed \"Programming Python\". It's a great reference, but good luck trying to learn Python succinctly and from scratch. It's like trying to learn English by reading the dictionary. I'll give it 3 out of 5 on correctness and completeness, but like trying to buy a pair of shoes at a giant Megamart with no department signs, you'll eventually just get frustrated and leave.\n", "\n  I was a total noob that wanted to learn to program and was advised to learn Python, since I want to do some text analysis. I started out with Learn Python the Hard Way (to mind numbing), tried CodeCademy.com (to general) and watched a lot of videos on youtube (too fragmented) and read a lot of different specialized books on Python (like Python for Data Analysis). THIS book is finally the one that step-by-step in a good old school-teacher way is the perfect fit for me. Gentle, start at page 1 and go one page at the time forward - and it all makes sense and is perfectly balanced.I strongly recommend this book for anyone that is absolutely new to programming and have no ambitions to be a programmer, but only yo learn to use code as a tool.\n", "\nIn the 5th edition of this book, author Mark Lutz takes you on a comprehensive tour of the Python language. In this book he covers a lot of ground, and does so in an easy-to-understand way, making this book great for beginners, or for someone coming from another language. Moreover this book covers both Python 2.7.X and 3.X which is a big plus.Learning Python lives up to its title: after reading this book, someone new to programming altogether will walk away with a solid understanding of the Python language basics, including some advanced features. As mentioned this book covers a lot of ground, which is to be expected when it is 1600 pages long, however, it does so in an engaging manner. The author manages to convey the more complex concepts in a good way by breaking them down and walking you through a large range of examples. Furthermore, the writing style is very clear and it is obvious from the text that this author has a lot of experience teaching classes on Python as he seems to \"preempt\" any confusion before it arises.Compared to similar books, Learning Python goes deeper into each topic, and covers more topics than any one \"Learning\" or beginners' book that I have seen. I believe that's a real plus, as you are not left hanging with questions regarding a topic as one sometimes might be when reading books that just scratches the surface and gives a brief example of some language feature. Even though this book is appropriate for beginners, it introduces what is sometimes thought of as more advanced topics, such as list comprehensions, decorators, descriptors and generators. It is nice to see these features and more included in this comprehensive text as they have become more prevalent recently.Read more \u203a\n", "\n  Another reviewer said that trying to learn Python from this book is like trying to learn english by reading the dictionary, and that couldn't be more true. Each discrete topic is covered in minute detail, so it isn't until page 500 or so of this 1500+ page book that you will have covered enough of the basics to write even a simple program. One of Python's strongest selling points is that it's easy to jump in and get programming right away, regardless of prior knowledge, so this book's approach is a major turn-off for anyone that wants to learn through practice and experience.Speaking of which, readers will need to have at least some previous programming experience to make sense of this book, since it relies heavily on jargon that complete beginners are unlikely to understand. If you don't already know what functions, methods, strings, and such are (and experienced programmers here will laugh, but when you are first starting out, such terms can be confusing!) the author isn't going to explain, or if he does, it will be 200 pages later in a different section.A more minor complaint is the dry and formal, textbook-like voice of the author. I don't need to be constantly entertained while learning, but I do need to have fun, and a little humor and personality go a long way.I'm over a hundred pages in, and I give up. I need to actually program while learning to program. I was looking for a beginner friendly, tutorial style book that would encourage exploration and test my knowledge with quizzes. This isn't it. I think I will go back to my severely outdated copy of Beginning Python by Magnus Lie Hetland to brush up on basic program construction, then use this book as a reference as I get deeper into programming with Python.\n", "\n  It's been awhile since I read something that badly written in computer books.Don't get me wrong the guy knows his stuff and there is a lot of information hidden in there.Unfortunately it is truly hidden in unnecessary repetitions and fluff.It is not a book or reference or tutorial, this is something like a notes from Mark Lutz class, that he teaches. While in the class it is totally ok to revisit previous topics or not get distracted by advanced concepts in the book repetition and \"I'll talk about it later\" becomes super painful. Dear author, It's the book I can re-read previous topics as needed, there is no need to repeat it 20 times (and this is not an exaggeration).In fact the most used phrase- which you will meet on average twice per page is \"more on * later\" and \"as we discussed previously/(in chapter *)\". If you don't believe me do a regular expression search on it.This book would've been so much better if it was 1/5 in size with topics staying together (we have 3 places/chapters for strings in different places in the book and don't even get me started on classes presentation structure).Also it looks a little biased toward 2.6 version and old ways (% vs format for instance), the very important point of being able to re-use positional anchor with format statement is not even mentioned as an advantage \"{0}={0}.value\".format(\"var\") for example cannot do it with % have to type \"var\" twice.\n"], "details": ["Paperback: 1600 pages", "Publisher: O'Reilly Media; Fifth Edition edition (July 6, 2013)", "Language: English", "ISBN-10: 1449355730", "ISBN-13: 978-1449355739", "Product Dimensions: 9.3 x 7.1 x 2.8 inches", "Shipping Weight: 4.8 pounds (", "4.1 out of 5 stars", "57 customer reviews", "#2,749", "See Top 100 in Books", "Books", "Computers & Technology", "Programming", "Software Design, Testing & Engineering", "Object-Oriented Design", "Books", "Computers & Technology", "Programming", "Game Programming", "Books", "Textbooks", "Computer Science", "Object-Oriented Software Design", "Object-Oriented Design <span class=\"zg_hrsr_rank\">#1</span>", "Game Programming <span class=\"zg_hrsr_rank\">#1</span>", "Object-Oriented Software Design <span class=\"zg_hrsr_rank\">#1</span>"]}
