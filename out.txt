First off, I'm a heavy duty fan of GRRM. I've read over a 100 different  fantasy authors in my time (started at 12; I'm now 32). Took about 5  years off from the genre b/c I felt it was all getting too formulaic and  cliched.  So, when I came back to fantasy at the end of 1999, I read the usual:  Goodkind, Jordan, etc. and then someone told me about GRRM and  man, that was the kicker!  Here are the reasons to choose GRRM. I've also listed the reasons not to  choose him to make it fair b/c I know their are certain personalities who  won't like this series:  WHY TO READ GRRM  (1) YOU ARE TIRED OF FORMULAIC FANTASY: good lad beats  the dark lord against impossible odds; boy is the epitome of good; he and  all his friends never die even though they go through great dangers . . . the  good and noble king; the beautiful princess who falls in love with the  commoner boy even though their stations are drastically different  . . . you get the idea.  After reading this over and over, it gets old.  (2) YOU ARE TIRED OF ALL THE HEROES STAYING ALIVE  EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE UNDER CONSTANT DANGER: this  gets even worse where the author kills a main hero off but that person  comes back later in the story. Or, a hero does die but magic brings him  back.  This sometimes carries to minor characters where even they may not die,  but most fantasy authors like to kill them off to show that some risked the  adventure and perished.  (3) YOU ARE A MEDIEVAL HISTORY BUFF: this story was  influenced by the WARS OF THE ROSES and THE HUNDRED  YEARS WAR.  (4) YOU LOVE SERIOUS INTRIGUE WITHOUT STUPID  OPPONENTS: lots of layering; lots of intrigue; lots of clever players in  the game of thrones.Read more ›



I spent quite a while staring at the blank screen in front of me to come up with a fitting description of A Game of Thrones by George RR Martin.  Should I compare it to the classic Lord of the Rings for its impressively epic scope?  Would it be best to focus on the honest, often painful humanity of the many characters - so rare in a fantasy novel - that personalizes each point of view?  Perhaps I could impress other customers here with the sheer brilliance of a plot that weaves so many seemingly disparate stories together to form a believable alternate universe in which not only politics, intrigue, war, adventure and romance can coexist plausibly, but magic as well.  How could I do such a work justice?I might as well get this part out of the way first.  Obligatory Synopsis:  in a fantasy continent that bears a familiarity to Middle Ages England, Winter is coming.  Winter in this world means a sort of mini ice age that will last for seven years before receding. In the always-frosty Northern area, the races of nonhuman beings are gathering to advance with the snows; there are hints that there is an ancient, evil power behind their forces.  At the same time in the South, political infighting for the Throne has begun. Overseas, the daughter of the dispossessed former King is maneuvering forces of her own for a bid for the throne.  All this is told through the various stories of both "good guys" and not-so-good guys.For starters, AGOT can't be accurately compared to any other book or series in the Fantasy genre (not without insulting it).  The nearest thing of its type is the laborious Wheel of Time series by Jordan - see what I mean? And yet this first in the Song of Ice and Fire series is fathoms above that aimless, droning style.Read more ›



  NB: THIS REVIEW REFERS TO THE KINDLE EDITION ALONE!  This is a great book, and I've eaten up the series and have been on tenterhooks for George RR to get his finger out and publish A Dance with Dragons for YEARS now.  (And the tv series!! Be still my beating heart!!!)  But I have to comment on the extremely bad editing of the Kindle edition of A Game of Thrones.  It is sloppy and unprofessional.  When I first got my kindle, I never experienced this, but now it seems like every book gets worse and worse.  I thought Sacajawea was bad, but A Game of Thrones starts out with poor editing and gets progressively more appalling as you get further into the book.  People who only read the kindle edition will think that Princess Elia comes from Dome, since that is how it is (almost) consistently spelled throughout the book.  (It's Dorne).  But on the other hand, the `tom cat' is a `torn cat'- go figure.  Little things like that at first, but now, in the last third of the book, the mistakes are coming on nearly every page.  Random parentheses, inappropriately capitalized words, italics that make no sense, sentences that end abruptly - that kind of thing.  It would be irritating, but something I would just accept in a free edition of a book (maybe).  But for a Kindle book that costs more than the paperback, I expect more.  I also own a hard copy of this book, and none of these typos are in that edition.  I'm not sure how the Kindle editions are made, but I expect the same kind of professional editing that you get in print books.  You don't get that here, disappointingly.
