I recently finished a college course with this book.  I have a love hate relationship with the text.  For each bulleted Pro, I've often included a Con with the same number.This book comes with a program called raptor which can also be downloaded free of charge if you buy a used copy.Pros:1.The text and it's use of the program raptor create a easily understandable visual of loops and arrays which allow the reader to see programs in action.2.The in-chapter quizzes and end-chapter tests are frequent and help to assimilate the information.3.The layout of the book is ascetically appealing. (no con)4.Raptor is easy to use and assists the student in watching the code run. It also offers visual debugging.5.The book is laid out so well and the tests already made that even a sub-par teacher can successfully teach the course.6.The book uses pseudocode to help a student break down a program.Cons:1.The use of raptor has limited use to a programmer.  I feel my time was wasted learning a program which I will never again use.  I would love to see this teaching approach and chapter succession used with a language such as C# or Java.2.The in-chapter quizzes and end-chapter tests are often ambiguous and incorrect. Ambiguity is a programmer's nightmare.  At least 10% of my answers were marked wrong according to the teacher's answer key when they were in fact correct in definition or theory.  It was a daunting task to meet with my Prof. and have the answers corrected each week.  My Professor agreed with my findings each time and noted his answers for future classes.4.Raptor - In order to get some of the more complex programs to run, one needs to build loops in redundant way that doesn't transfer well to languages.5.Read more â€º


  This book is a great base builder for those people who know about computers but want to start getting into advance practices like programing.  A great text book.


  This teaches the logic behind all programming. If you don't know any programming languages, this is the place to start. It uses generic program language to get the core ideas into your mind while using Raptor to help you write actual programs. A lot of the psuedocode written is almost verbatim for Python, however. So, if you pick up Head First Python to use in conjunction with this book, then you WILL LEARN to program in an actual high level language.


  Uses the Raptor flowchart software from lockheed martin.  Does not include everything you need to know about the software, but following the logic in the examples helps understand what is going on in the programming procedures


  I entered my programming class with absolutely no experience writing code. This book helps the student develop the necessary skills to practically think like a programmer. I successfully passed my introductory programming class and this book was definitely a part of my success. Easy to read and friendly to beginners - glad that I purchased this item.


  I ordered Prelude to Programming: Concepts and Design (5th Edition) (Pearson Custom Computer Science) for a intro to computer science class and ordered this book for that class. Shipping was fast considering I shipped it to a APO/AP address. The book itself was disappointing. The cover was half flatten and the sides were not cut properly giving the book a used feeling. It might be from the specific seller but the defects warrant better QA. The book itself gives examples from various languages causing some confusion for new programmers. All in all it was a pretty good beginner book into programming and its design.


  I understand it was used, or something, the corners were rubbed a lot so it added to the "used" book expectation, some pages had remnants of dried up water, or another clear liquid. However, over all, when you account for the big discount in comparison to school retail fees, and the fact that there was no hassel getting it. It was a great buy.
