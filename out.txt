  This book is absolutely amazing. It is chock full of great information for the dieter who is looking to increase his knowledge on how exactly grains and different types of carbs can affect your brain.I really enjoyed the writer's style, it helped keep me engaged and interested in the content, unlike other books on the same subject. The most interesting part is that I was able to lose a significant amount of weight just by following some of the guidelines in the book. I also took a supplement called Garcinia Cambogia that has only accelerated my weight loss.I have a child with ADHD so I really enjoyed the fact that ADHD and different types of gluten sensitivity were covered in grain brain. Since I have previously been on the primal diet, I knew some of the information since the two diets were similar, but not exactly the same. Prior to reading it I believed that gluten free and grain free were exactly the same which is not always the case.I recommend that anyone read this book, it's a quick read and contains a ton of great information that can be extremely helpful. I was lucky to get this book as a gift from my lovely brother in law (Marcus) and really owe him one for this great read.


When I saw this title, I knew I had to read it. "Grain Brain" brought images of a cow at a computer. Since I am very interested in both the mind and good health, I wanted to learn more. Like so many people, I want to do anything I can to avoid dementia and Alzheimer's.So, who is Dr. Perlmutter and why should we listen to him? It turns out that he is one of the leading integrative medicine neurologists in North America today. He is the author of The Better Brain Book: The Best Tool for Improving Memory and Sharpness and Preventing Aging of the Brain and Power Up Your Brain. Like Dr. Oz and Dr. Andrew Weil, he integrates conventional medicine diagnosis and treatment with the latest innovations in nutritional and environmental medicine. I love medical doctors who have traditional training and look for prevention rather than cure.Dr. Perlmutter makes a bold promise that this program can help people with:* ADHD* Depression* Diabetes* Epilepsy* Insomnia* Intestinal problems* Memory problems and much moreAccording to Dr. Perlmutter, the number one cause of brain disease is inflammation. Inflammation is our body's natural response to some kind of stress in the body. Prolonged inflammation leads to a reduction of cellular function followed by cellular destruction. This damages your body and your brain.So, where is this inflammation coming from?  The main source is processed food. The sugars, simple carbs, some fruits and fruity drinks and fast foods that are causing diabetes are also causing brain degeneration.Read more ›


  I am a low carber, and I thought I was pretty up on things.  I've lost 35 pounds, gotten off of meds that had nasty side effects, and felt pretty knowledgeable about low carbohydrate eating.  However, I am gaining weight back, mainly from cheating, and after reading this book, I know which cheats are causing me real distress!  Who would think that the glycemic index for a piece of whole grain bread is higher than that of table sugar?I know I am extra sensitive to carbohydrates, but have always thought that I could eat foods containing gluten with no penalty except for the carbs.  I have changed my mind.This book is clearly written and sends up the warning flag for how our modern diets are killing us early.  Add to that our penchant for cheap food that allows Monsanto to march on with their GMO program, and we are heading down a slippery slope.Time to wake up.  Read this book.  Heed the author's warning.  Change your way of eating.  Clear up your brain fog, reduce your waistline, preserve your youth a little longer.  Well worth the read.


This book is phenomenal.  There is SO much good information in here.  I'm not a fast reader, but I read this book in one day; I couldn't put it down.  The writing style is very easy to understand and interesting.  The info is invaluable.  This is one of the gamechanger books!There are so many things to learn about.  Such as!  The fatter you get, the more your brain shrinks (this explains a lot for me)!  And the portion of your brain that shrinks is the cognitive and memory portions. And the fact that diabetes sets you up for dementia and Alzheimer's.  There is lots of information on inflammation and its role in many illnesses, including nervous and brain diseases.  There is also info in here on depression and how a lot of it is related to gluten sensitivity.  ADHD is covered in depth.  This book should enable many people to get off  medications if they will try this lifestyle.  I have easily thought of a dozen people I think would be helped by reading it.  If I could, I would order multiple copies to give away.  This book has so much really important information for so many people.There was much information on gluten sensitivity and insulin sensitivity.  He went into lots of great detail on how many different ways the diet influences your body and your state of health (or disease)!  I am going to reread this book and make lots of notes on all this important information (that's how good this book is; I normally don't do that).A lot of the information in this book I knew about from studying up on the Paleo diet.  The diet is very similar to Paleo, but not the same; I noticed a few differences.  (For example, this book is for gluten free whereas Paleo is straight grain free.Read more ›
